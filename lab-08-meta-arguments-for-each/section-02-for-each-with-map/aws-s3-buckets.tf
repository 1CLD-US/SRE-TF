####Note regarding lab usage of and the Resource blocks#########
####Replace all references to lab Pod Number 0 with your unqiue, assigned pod number
####Example - aws_vpc resource block - replace both the resource name (vpc-dev-1) and the tags Name
####value (vpc-dev-1) to include your own pod number such as - "vpc-dev-<pod-number>"
####If preferred and for expidency/precision - considering doing a replace all such as - replace all 
####occurances of -0 with -1
